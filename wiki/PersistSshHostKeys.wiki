# Save ssh host keys to persistent partition

= Introduction =

For security reasons, I've removed *ssh host keys* from persistent partition and I made a slight change in ssh service script to generate new ones if they don't exists.

= Details =

Until you do this, every boot new keys will be generated and stored under volatile partiontion (/rw)

{{{
remountrw
mv /rw/etc/ssh/ssh_host_* /ro/etc/ssh/
remountro
}}}
