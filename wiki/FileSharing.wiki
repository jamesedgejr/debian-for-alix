= File Sharing =

When you plug an external hard disk, it'll be mounted under */mnt/* using its *label*, for partition without label will mounted as *hdusb-sdX*

*/mnt* and all of its content is ready to be accessed by services below:
 * Web browser (read only) http://alix.site/mnt/ or https://alix.site/mnt/
 * Win share (read write) \\alix\mnt\
 * Secure FTP (also known sFTP), its run over SSH, you can use root login to access entire system. FileZilla is very good sftp client.

vsFTPd provides anonymous ftp access, but its was pointed to /srv/ftp, and there are no files.
If you wish to serve your files by ftp, just add parameter *anon_root=/mnt* on the end of file */etc/vsftpd.conf*, see below:
{{{
echo anon_root=/mnt >> /etc/vsftpd.conf
remountrw
mv /rw/etc/vsftpd.conf /ro/etc/
remountro
}}}

_You can also enable authenticated ftp access, see sample below_
{{{
remountrw
rebind on
chroot /ro

echo local_enable=YES >> /etc/vsftpd.conf
echo chroot_local_user=YES >> /etc/vsftpd.conf
useradd -d /mnt -s /bin/false alixftp
passwd alixftp
history -c

exit
rebind off
remoutro
}}}
