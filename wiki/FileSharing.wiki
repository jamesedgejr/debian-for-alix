= File Sharing =

When you plug an external hard disk, it'll be mounted under */mnt/* using its *label*, for partition without label will mounted as *hdusb-sdX*

*/mnt* and all of its content is ready to be accessed by services below:
 * Web browser (read only) http://alix.site/mnt/ or https://alix.site/mnt/
 * Win share (read write) \\alix\mnt\
 * FTP client (read only) ftp://alix.site
 * Secure FTP (ready write) sftp://alix.site _Its run over SSH, you can use root login to access entire system. FileZilla is very good sftp client._
 * Media Server (read only) use any DLNA compatible client.

FTP server was also configured to accept authenticated (read write) access, just create the users on Linux OS. 
example:
{{{
remountrw
rebind on
chroot /ro
useradd -d /mnt -s /bin/false alixftp
passwd alixftp
history -c
exit
rebind off
remountro
}}}
