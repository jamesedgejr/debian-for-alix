= File Sharing =

When you plug an external hard disk, it'll be mounted under */mnt/* using its *label*, for partition without label will mounted as *hdusb-sdX*

*/mnt* and all of its content is ready to be accessed by services below:
 * Web browser (read only) http://alix.site/mnt/ or https://alix.site/mnt/
 * Win share (read write) \\alix\mnt\
 * Secure FTP (also known sFTP), its run over SSH, you can use root login to access entire system. FileZilla is very good sftp client.

vsFTPd provides anonymous ftp access, but its was pointed to /srv/ftp, and there are no files.
If you wish to serve your files by ftp, just change homedir from user ftp, see below:
{{{
remountrw
rebind on
chroot /ro

usermod -d /mnt ftp

history -c
exit
rebind off
remoutro
}}}

You can enable authenticate ftp service too by editing */etc/vsftpd.conf* and uncommenting *local_enable=YES* and *chroot_local_user=YES*

{{{
remountrw
rebind on
chroot /ro

# use your preferred text editot
nano /etc/vsftpd.conf

useradd -d /mnt -s /bin/false alixftp
passwd alixftp

history -c
exit
rebind off
remoutro
}}}
