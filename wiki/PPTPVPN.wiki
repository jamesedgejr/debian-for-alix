# VPN Server


*PPTP VPN Server* was chose because MS Win has a built in client since XP, other OS like Mac OS, iOS, Android and Linux also have support.

That service is enabled by default, to use it you just need to add users on */etc/ppp/chap-secrets*

After client connects, It'll receive a IP in local network range, so it'll able to access any other hosts in your local network as It was there.

example:
{{{
# use your preferred text editor
nano /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
remountrw 
mv /rw/etc/ppp/chap-secrets /ro/etc/ppp/
remountro
}}}

/etc/ppp/chap-secrets example
{{{
# Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client        server  secret                  IP addresses
john            pptpd   johnPWD                 *
mary            pptpd   maryPWD                 *
lucy            pptpd   lucyPWD                 *
peter           pptpd   peterPWD                *
