It's a Debian 6.0.4 image ready to use on ALIX board, just download and write on 2G (or bigger) compact flash.

Below, some features/services:

- read only file system, it protects against power failures and substantially increases compact flash life time.

- common services available on first boot:
-- serial terminal [ 38400n8 ]
-- dnsmasq [ dns and dhcp servers ]
-- iptables [ basic firewall rules and internet sharing ]
-- samba [ MS Win file share ]
-- cups [ print server ]

- Regular system maintenance through apt-get, use it to update, install and remove applications and patches.

- It's Debian Squeeze i386, so any available software for that platform can be installed, regards hardware power limitations of ALIX boards.

Enjoy!
