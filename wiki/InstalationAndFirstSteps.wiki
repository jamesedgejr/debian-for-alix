# Instalation and first steps

= Introduction =

All of you want to get your system runnning


= writing image on CF =

 * *download the image splitted files* 
http://code.google.com/p/debian-for-alix/downloads/list

 * *concatenate them to a single image file *

`cat debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz-split-* > debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz`

 * *verify the checksum of debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz* _this step is not required, recommended to avoid broken files._

`sha1sum debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz`  

_or_  

`md5sum debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz`  

_and compare against published sha1sum or md5sum on downloads section._

 * *write it on a 2GB (or bigger) compact flash*

`zcat debian-alix-cf2g.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sd*X* bs=16k`

_/dev/sd*X* maybe /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc ... according your environment_


= first boot pre-configured settings =

*used on alix3d13 - 3 RJ45 ports*

 * serial port: 38400n8
 * WAN IP: dhcp (RJ45 beside power plug)
 * LAN IP: *172.16.210.254*/255.255.255.0 (other two RJ45 in bridge mode)
 * hostname: alix.site
 * ssh server: 22 (default port)
 * *root* password: *123456*
 * char set: en_US.UTF8
 * LAN dhcp server: 172.16.210.121 - 172.16.210.200
 * WLAN: disable by default, because many people doesn't have one

= save your changes =

The "/" partition is the union of "/ro" (persistent) and "/rw" (volatile), then by default all of your changes over "/" will be saved on "/rw", keeping "/ro" unchanged, so changes will be lost every boot. 

I'll show you two ways to persist you changes:

* 1: move changed files from volatile to persistent partition*
 * do changes normally (edit files, run commands, restart services, do tests)
 * run *remountrw* to enable write on /ro
 * *move* changed files *from* /rw *to* /ro
 * run *remountro* to disable write on /ro
 
* 2: use chroot environment write direct over /ro partition *

_recommended to install/update/remove applications and complex changes involving many files_

 * run *remountrw* to enable write on /ro
 * run *rebind on* to mount system partitions under chrooted environment
 * run *chroot /ro* to enter in chroot environment, "/ro" will be shown as "/"
 * do your changes, they'll be saved direct on persistent partition
 * run *exit* to get out chrooted environment and back to the true "/" environment
 * run *rebind off* to umount system partitions under chrooted environment
 * run *remountro* to disable write on /ro

_when your changes restart some service while you are inside chroot environment, you'll probably need run *lsof /ro* to find process that are locking resources and kill them before successfully use *rebind off* and *remountro*_

_If commands before don't help you, at last option reboot system, so is strongly recommeded run *fsck -a /dev/sda1* after system boots_
